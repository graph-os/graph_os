# GraphOS Implementation Tasks

## Component API Design: Plug-Inspired Approach

This document outlines the implementation plan for the GraphOS Component API using a Plug-inspired design pattern. The approach allows for composable components that integrate with both the Graph data structure and MCP protocol without duplicating interface code.

### Core Concepts

- **Context**: Similar to `Plug.Conn`, a struct that holds request/response data and flows through the component pipeline
- **Components**: Modules that implement the Component behavior with `init/1` and `call/2` functions
- **Tools & Resources**: Declarative APIs for defining executable operations and queryable resources
- **Pipelines**: Composable chains of components that transform the context

### Refactoring Plan: Graph-Centered Component Architecture

#### Phase 1: Conceptual Realignment (High Priority)

1. [âœ“] **Initial Component API Implementation**
   - ~~Implement `GraphOS.Component.Context` module~~
   - ~~Create `GraphOS.Component` behavior~~
   - ~~Develop DSL for tool and resource definitions~~
   - ~~Implement component pipeline functionality~~

2. [ ] **Refactor Component Registry to use Graph as the central registry**
   - Convert `GraphOS.Component.Registry` to use Graph store for registry operations
   - Implement component capabilities as Graph nodes (tools as executable nodes, resources as queryable nodes)
   - Remove standalone registry ETS table in favor of Graph topology
   - Update tests to reflect Graph as the central registry

3. [ ] **Define Graph topology for Component capabilities**
   - Define node types for components, tools, and resources
   - Design edge relationships (component provides tool/resource, tool requires permission, etc.)
   - Create schema validation for component nodes
   - Add migration path for existing components to Graph-based architecture

4. [ ] **Create Graph query/action handlers for Component operations**
   - Implement query handlers that resolve to resource functions
   - Implement action handlers that execute tool functions 
   - Create a standardized response format for component operations via Graph
   - Add error handling and context propagation

#### Phase 2: Runtime Integration (Medium Priority)

5. [ ] **Implement Component Registration System**
   - Create startup registration mechanism for components to register with Graph
   - Develop runtime APIs for component lifecycle management (start, stop, update)
   - Add introspection capabilities to examine available components
   - Implement dependency resolution between components

6. [ ] **Design Component Config System**
   - Create a configuration schema for components
   - Implement config loading and validation
   - Support environment-based config overrides
   - Add live config reload capabilities

7. [ ] **Access Control Integration**
   - Map component tools/resources to access control permissions automatically
   - Implement permission checking in Graph query/action handlers
   - Add capability-based security model for components
   - Create test harness for component permission verification

#### Phase 3: Protocol Adaptation (Medium Priority)

8. [ ] **Create unified MCP -> Graph translation layer**
   - Implement a single MCP adapter that translates all requests to Graph operations
   - Map MCP methods directly to Graph paths (e.g., `git.log -> graph.query("git.log", args)`)
   - Create bidirectional serialization between MCP and Graph contexts
   - Add comprehensive tests for protocol translation

9. [ ] **Update MCP tool schema generation**
   - Generate MCP tool schemas directly from Graph capability nodes
   - Implement automatic versioning for tool schemas
   - Create batched operations for MCP -> Graph translations
   - Add schema diff tools for capability evolution

10. [ ] **Add Server Discovery Mechanism**
    - Create service discovery for available Graph capabilities
    - Implement dynamic tool registration based on runtime Graph state
    - Add health checking and status reporting
    - Create capability advertising mechanism

#### Phase 4: Developer Experience (Lower Priority)

11. [ ] **Create middleware components**
    - Implement validation middleware for Graph operations
    - Create logging/telemetry middleware
    - Add error handling middleware with standardized formats
    - Design transaction middleware for multi-step Graph operations

12. [ ] **Documentation and examples**
    - Document Graph as the central runtime concept
    - Create examples showing component registration with Graph
    - Add tutorials for querying/executing through Graph
    - Document MCP as just one possible interface to Graph

13. [ ] **Tooling improvements**
    - Create GraphOS CLI for component management
    - Implement Graph visualization tools
    - Add debugging facilities for component operations
    - Create deployment tools for component distribution

### Integration Plan

1. Start with a small proof-of-concept component (e.g., `GraphOS.Core.Example`)
2. Adapt existing code incrementally to use the new Component API
3. Create adapters for existing MCP implementations to ensure backward compatibility
4. Convert core modules to components one at a time, ensuring tests pass at each step

### Success Criteria

- All core functionality is accessible through the Component API
- MCP interface is automatically generated from component definitions
- Components can be composed into pipelines for complex operations
- Existing tests continue to pass with the new implementation
- Documentation is comprehensive and includes examples

### Design Considerations

- **Performance**: Optimize the context transformation pipeline for minimal overhead
- **Composability**: Ensure components can be easily combined and reused
- **Extensibility**: Allow for custom context transformations and middleware
- **Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility with existing Graph and MCP interfaces
- **Security**: Ensure access control is properly enforced in all component operations
