# GraphOS Implementation Tasks

## Component API Design: Plug-Inspired Approach

This document outlines the implementation plan for the GraphOS Component API using a Plug-inspired design pattern. The approach allows for composable components that integrate with both the Graph data structure and MCP protocol without duplicating interface code.

### Core Concepts

- **Context**: Similar to `Plug.Conn`, a struct that holds request/response data and flows through the component pipeline
- **Components**: Modules that implement the Component behavior with `init/1` and `call/2` functions
- **Tools & Resources**: Declarative APIs for defining executable operations and queryable resources
- **Pipelines**: Composable chains of components that transform the context

### Implementation Tasks

#### Phase 1: Core Structure (High Priority)

1. [ ] **Implement `GraphOS.Component.Context` module**
   - Define context struct with request/response fields
   - Implement helper functions for transforming context (assign, put_result, put_error, halted?)
   - Add tests for context transformations

2. [ ] **Create `GraphOS.Component` behavior**
   - Define `init/1` and `call/2` callbacks
   - Implement `__using__` macro with default implementations
   - Create protocol implementations for GraphOS.Executable and GraphOS.Queryable
   - Add tests for component behavior

3. [ ] **Develop DSL for tool and resource definitions**
   - Implement `tool` and `resource` macros in `GraphOS.Component.Builder`
   - Create registry mechanisms for tools and resources
   - Add tests for DSL macros

4. [ ] **Implement component pipeline functionality**
   - Create pipeline builder function
   - Implement error handling and halting behavior
   - Add tests for pipeline execution

#### Phase 2: Graph Integration (Medium Priority)

5. [ ] **Adapt `GraphOS.Graph` to work with components**
   - Extend the Graph API to recognize components as special node types
   - Implement execute and query routing for component nodes
   - Add tests for component-graph integration

6. [ ] **Component node registration**
   - Define mechanism for components to register their nodes in the graph
   - Create automatic node generation from tool/resource definitions
   - Add tests for node registration

7. [ ] **Access control integration**
   - Extend access control to handle component operations
   - Implement permission checking in component execution
   - Add tests for component access control

#### Phase 3: MCP Integration (Medium Priority)

8. [ ] **Create MCP adapter component**
   - Implement `GraphOS.MCP.Adapter` component for protocol translation
   - Create mappers between MCP requests and component contexts
   - Add tests for MCP adapter

9. [ ] **Tool and resource exposure via MCP**
   - Implement automatic tool registration from component definitions
   - Create schema generators for MCP tool definitions
   - Add tests for MCP tool exposure

10. [ ] **Server configuration via components**
    - Create mechanism for components to influence MCP server configuration
    - Implement aggregation of server configurations
    - Add tests for server configuration

#### Phase 4: Extension and Documentation (Lower Priority)

11. [ ] **Create middleware components**
    - Implement validation middleware
    - Create logging middleware
    - Add error handling middleware
    - Add tests for each middleware

12. [ ] **Documentation and examples**
    - Create comprehensive documentation for the Component API
    - Write example components for common use cases
    - Add tutorials for building custom components

13. [ ] **Tooling and developer experience**
    - Implement generators for new components
    - Create debugging tools for component pipelines
    - Add telemetry integration for performance monitoring

### Integration Plan

1. Start with a small proof-of-concept component (e.g., `GraphOS.Core.Example`)
2. Adapt existing code incrementally to use the new Component API
3. Create adapters for existing MCP implementations to ensure backward compatibility
4. Convert core modules to components one at a time, ensuring tests pass at each step

### Success Criteria

- All core functionality is accessible through the Component API
- MCP interface is automatically generated from component definitions
- Components can be composed into pipelines for complex operations
- Existing tests continue to pass with the new implementation
- Documentation is comprehensive and includes examples

### Design Considerations

- **Performance**: Optimize the context transformation pipeline for minimal overhead
- **Composability**: Ensure components can be easily combined and reused
- **Extensibility**: Allow for custom context transformations and middleware
- **Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility with existing Graph and MCP interfaces
- **Security**: Ensure access control is properly enforced in all component operations
