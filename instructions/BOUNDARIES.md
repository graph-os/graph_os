# GraphOS Component Boundaries

This document defines the boundaries and responsibilities of each component in the GraphOS architecture.

## Overall Architecture

GraphOS is designed as a collection of focused applications, each with a specific responsibility:

1. **tmux**: Development tooling with mix tasks
2. **mcp**: Messaging and communication protocol
3. **graph_os_graph**: Pure graph data structure library
4. **graph_os_core**: Core GraphOS functionality and infrastructure
5. **graph_os_protocol**: Protocol interfaces (HTTP, JSON-RPC, gRPC, SSE)
6. **graph_os_dev**: Development tools and interfaces

## Component Dependencies

The dependency flow is strictly downward:

```
tmux
  ↓
mcp
  ↓
graph_os_graph
  ↓
graph_os_core
  ↓
graph_os_protocol
  ↓
graph_os_dev
```

## Component Responsibilities

### graph_os_graph

#### Key Boundary Rules
- GraphOS.Graph is a pure graph data structure library
- It defines interfaces but not implementations for cross-cutting concerns

- Protocol adapters have been moved to GraphOS.Protocol
- Node execution logic has been moved to GraphOS.Core

#### Dependencies
- `mcp` - For serialization (limited usage)

#### Public API

#### Responsibilities
- Graph data structures (nodes, edges)

### graph_os_core

Core GraphOS functionality and infrastructure.

#### Dependencies
- `tmux` - For development workflow tools
- `mcp` - For protocol communication
- `graph_os_graph` - For graph data structures and operations

#### Public API
- `GraphOS.Core` - Main module for core operations

- `GraphOS.Core.Executable.*` - Executable management
- `GraphOS.Core.MCP.*` - MCP server implementations

#### Responsibilities
- Application lifecycle management
- Component registry and discovery
- Access control implementation
- Integration with external systems
- Executable graph management
- File watching and monitoring
- Git integration

### graph_os_protocol

### graph_os_dev

Development tools and interfaces.

#### Dependencies

### tmux

Development tooling.

#### Dependencies
None (standalone library)

#### Public API
- `Tmux` - Main module for tmux utilities
- `Mix.Tasks.*` - Mix tasks

#### Responsibilities

- Mix tasks

## Cross-Component Communication

- **graph_os_dev** → **graph_os_protocol** → **graph_os_core**: UI uses Protocol interfaces which use Core functionality
- **graph_os_core** → **graph_os_graph**: Core uses Graph for data storage and queries
- **graph_os_graph** → **mcp**: Graph can use MCP for serialization
- All components may use **tmux** for development tooling

## Breaking Boundary Changes

Any change that affects the public API of a component must:
1. Be documented in the component's CHANGELOG.md
2. Be reflected in this BOUNDARIES.md file
3. Update the component's README.md file
4. Include appropriate version changes following semantic versioning

## Enforcing Boundaries

Boundaries are enforced through:
1. Mix dependencies in each application's mix.exs
2. Runtime checks for proper API usage
3. Comprehensive test coverage at boundaries
