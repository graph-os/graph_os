# GraphOS Implementation Tasks

### Core Concepts

- **Context**: Similar to `Plug.Conn`, a struct that holds request/response data and flows through the component pipeline
- **Components**: Modules that implement the Component behavior with `init/1` and `call/2` functions
- **Tools & Resources**: Declarative APIs for defining executable operations and queryable resources
- **Pipelines**: Composable chains of components that transform the context


### Design Considerations

- **Performance**: Optimize the context transformation pipeline for minimal overhead
- **Composability**: Ensure components can be easily combined and reused
- **Extensibility**: Allow for custom context transformations and middleware
- **Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility with existing Graph and MCP interfaces
- **Security**: Ensure access control is properly enforced in all component operations
- **Protocol Flexibility**: Support multiple communication protocols without code duplication
