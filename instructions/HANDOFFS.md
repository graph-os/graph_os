# GraphOS Task Handoffs

## Purpose
This document serves as a handoff registry between agents working in different components of the GraphOS project. Handoffs represent tasks that need coordination across component boundaries.

## How to Use This Document

1. **Create a handoff** when you need work completed in another component
2. **Update the status** as the handoff progresses through its lifecycle
3. **Include all necessary context** so the receiving agent can understand the task

## Handoff Format

Each handoff should include:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for the handoff (e.g., HANDOFF-001)
- **Source**: Component initiating the handoff
- **Target**: Component receiving the handoff
- **Description**: Brief description of the task
- **Context**: Detailed context with requirements, constraints, and expectations
- **Status**: Current status (Delivered/Received/In Progress/Completed)
- **Timestamp**: When the handoff was created or last updated
- **Dependencies**: Any dependencies this handoff relies on

## Active Handoffs
*No active handoffs at this time.*

### HANDOFF-001

- **ID**: HANDOFF-001
- **Source**: graph_os_protocol
- **Target**: graph_os_graph
- **Description**: Implement protobuf-based schema behavior in graph library
- **Status**: Completed
- **Timestamp**: 2025-03-16 00:00:00 CET
- **Completed**: 2025-03-16 02:52:59 CET

**Context**:

We're building an upgradable protocol system based on Protocol Buffers. The current implementation plan requires changes to the GraphOS.GraphContext schema system to use protobuf types as the canonical representation.

**Requirements**:

1. Extend `GraphOS.GraphContext.SchemaBehaviour` to support protobuf as the primary schema definition:
   - Add `proto_definition/0` callback that returns a protobuf schema definition
   - Add `proto_field_mapping/0` callback that maps protobuf fields to graph fields
   - Support all standard protobuf types (int32, int64, string, bool, bytes, etc.)
   - Support message composition and nesting

2. Enhance `GraphOS.GraphContext.Schema` module to:
   - Generate schema validations directly from protobuf definitions
   - Handle protobuf enum definitions
   - Support repeated fields (lists)
   - Support map fields

3. Create `GraphOS.GraphContext.Schema.Protobuf` module that:
   - Provides utilities to work with protobuf definitions
   - Includes functions to validate data against protobuf schemas
   - Has helpers to convert between protobuf and Elixir data structures

**Integration Points**:

Once implemented, `GraphOS.Protocol` will build protocol adapters (JSONRPC, Plug, MCP) that can:
1. Accept a protobuf message
2. Use the schema behavior to validate and convert it
3. "Upgrade" the message to different protocol formats as needed

The protocol adapters will use this enhanced schema system as the canonical source of truth, ensuring type safety and consistency across all protocols.

**Notes**:
- The existing schema system should continue to work for backwards compatibility
- New schemas should adopt the protobuf-based approach
- No translation between type systems should occur; protobuf types are canonical

**Completion Notes**:
- Implementation added two new callbacks to SchemaBehaviour: `proto_definition/0` and `proto_field_mapping/0`
- Created GraphOS.GraphContext.Schema.Protobuf with utilities for parsing and validating protobuf schemas
- Enhanced Schema.Adapter with improved support for protobuf type mappings
- Added support for all required protobuf types including nested messages, enums, maps, and repeated fields
- Updated existing base schemas (BaseNode, BaseEdge) to use protobuf
- Added comprehensive test suite and example implementation
- All tests passing
