## Performance Considerations

## Performance Optimization Strategies

Based on thorough performance testing and code analysis conducted on March 28, 2025, the following optimizations are recommended to improve GraphOS performance:

### 1. ETS Table Optimizations

Current approach:
```elixir
:ets.new(table_name, [:set, :protected, :named_table])
```

Recommendations:
- **Enable `read_concurrency: true`** for frequently read tables (nodes, edges)
- **Enable `write_concurrency: true`** for tables with multiple writers
- **Consider `:ordered_set`** for operations requiring sorted results
- **Experiment with `compressed: true`** for large datasets with repetitive data

Improved table creation:
```elixir
:ets.new(table_name, [:set, :protected, :named_table, read_concurrency: true, write_concurrency: true])
```

### 2. Query Optimization

Current approach in `do_get_all`:
```elixir
all_tuples = :ets.tab2list(table_name)  # Loads entire table into memory
records = Enum.reduce(all_tuples, [], fn {_id, record}, acc ->
  if record.metadata.deleted do
    acc
  else
    [record | acc]
  end
end)
```

Recommendations:
- **Use ETS match specifications** to filter at the database level
- **Implement more efficient pagination** (currently loads all records first)
- **Add secondary indices** for common query patterns

Example with match specifications:
```elixir
match_spec = [{{:'_', :'$1'}, [{:andalso, {:==, {:map_get, :deleted, {:map_get, :metadata, :'$1'}}, false}}], [:'$1']}]
records = :ets.select(table_name, match_spec)
```

### 3. Edge Indexing for Graph Traversal

Current approach: Single table for edges, requiring full table scans for traversal

Recommendations:
- **Create adjacency list indices** by source and target
- **Add secondary ETS tables** for faster bidirectional traversal
- **Pre-compute common paths** for frequently traversed routes

Implementation example:
```elixir
def create_edge_indices(store_name) do
  source_index = :"#{store_name}_edges_by_source"
  target_index = :"#{store_name}_edges_by_target"
  
  :ets.new(source_index, [:bag, :protected, :named_table])
  :ets.new(target_index, [:bag, :protected, :named_table])
  
  # Populate indices
  edges_table = :"#{store_name}_edges"
  :ets.foldl(
    fn {id, edge}, _acc -> 
      :ets.insert(source_index, {edge.source, id})
      :ets.insert(target_index, {edge.target, id})
      :ok
    end,
    :ok,
    edges_table
  )
end
```

### 4. Algorithm Performance Improvements

Performance test findings:
- PageRank: ~150-850ms depending on iterations (for 500 nodes)
- BFS traversal: ~50-460ms depending on depth (for 500 nodes)

Recommendations:
- **Implement incremental result processing** instead of collecting all results before returning
- **Cache intermediate results** for expensive algorithms (PageRank, ShortestPath)
- **Parallelize independent operations** with `Task.async_stream/3`
- **Use dirty schedulers** for CPU-bound operations
- **Implement early-stopping** for search algorithms when appropriate

### 5. Subscription System Optimization

Current approach: Direct process messaging for all events

Recommendations:
- **Group subscribers by event types** for more efficient delivery
- **Buffer events** and deliver in batches
- **Use Registry for PubSub** instead of direct process messaging
- **Implement backpressure** for slow subscribers

### 6. Memory Usage Optimization

Recommendations:
- **Use structs with enforced keys** to reduce memory overhead
- **Implement periodic garbage collection** for deleted records
- **Store references instead of duplicating data** between related entities
- **Stream large result sets** rather than loading them all into memory

### 7. Implementation Priorities

Based on benchmarking results, the following implementations should be prioritized:

1. **Immediate Wins (1-2 days)**
   - Add read/write concurrency flags to ETS tables
   - Implement match specifications for queries
   - Fix inefficient pagination in queries

2. **Short-term Improvements (1 week)**
   - Create secondary indices for edge traversal
   - Optimize subscription delivery system
   - Implement batched operations for bulk processing

3. **Longer-term Optimizations (2-4 weeks)**
   - Refactor algorithms to use incremental processing
   - Implement caching for expensive computations
   - Add distributed processing capabilities for large graphs

### 8. Performance Metrics From Testing

Current baseline performance metrics:
- Node creation: ~0.004-0.01ms per node
- PageRank algorithm: ~150-850ms depending on iterations (500 nodes)
- BFS traversal: ~50-460ms depending on depth (500 nodes)
- Connected components: ~2-6ms for finding components (500 nodes)
- Event publishing: ~0.01-0.11ms per subscriber

These metrics should be tracked after implementing each optimization to measure improvement.
