## Performance Optimization Strategies

Based on thorough performance testing and code analysis conducted on March 28, 2025, the following optimizations are recommended to improve GraphOS performance:

### 1. ETS Table Optimizations

Current approach:
```elixir
:ets.new(table_name, [:set, :protected, :named_table])
```

Recommendations:
- **Enable `read_concurrency: true`** for frequently read tables (nodes, edges)
- **Enable `write_concurrency: true`** for tables with multiple writers
- **Consider `:ordered_set`** for operations requiring sorted results
- **Experiment with `compressed: true`** for large datasets with repetitive data

Improved table creation:
```elixir
:ets.new(table_name, [:set, :protected, :named_table, read_concurrency: true, write_concurrency: true])
```

### 2. Query Optimization

Current approach in `do_get_all`:
```elixir
all_tuples = :ets.tab2list(table_name)  # Loads entire table into memory
records = Enum.reduce(all_tuples, [], fn {_id, record}, acc ->
  if record.metadata.deleted do
    acc
  else
    [record | acc]
  end
end)
```

Recommendations:
- **Use ETS match specifications** to filter at the database level
- **Implement more efficient pagination** (currently loads all records first)
- **Add secondary indices** for common query patterns

Example with match specifications:
```elixir
match_spec = [{{:'_', :'$1'}, [{:andalso, {:==, {:map_get, :deleted, {:map_get, :metadata, :'$1'}}, false}}], [:'$1']}]
records = :ets.select(table_name, match_spec)
```

### 3. Edge Indexing for Graph Traversal

Current approach: Single table for edges, requiring full table scans for traversal

Recommendations:
- **Create adjacency list indices** by source and target
- **Add secondary ETS tables** for faster bidirectional traversal
- **Pre-compute common paths** for frequently traversed routes

Implementation example:
```elixir
def create_edge_indices(store_name) do
  source_index = :"#{store_name}_edges_by_source"
  target_index = :"#{store_name}_edges_by_target"
  
  :ets.new(source_index, [:bag, :protected, :named_table])
  :ets.new(target_index, [:bag, :protected, :named_table])
  
  # Populate indices
  edges_table = :"#{store_name}_edges"
  :ets.foldl(
    fn {id, edge}, _acc -> 
      :ets.insert(source_index, {edge.source, id})
      :ets.insert(target_index, {edge.target, id})
      :ok
    end,
    :ok,
    edges_table
  )
end
```

### 4. Algorithm Performance Improvements

Performance test findings:
- PageRank: ~150-850ms depending on iterations (for 500 nodes)
- BFS traversal: ~50-460ms depending on depth (for 500 nodes)

Recommendations:
- **Implement incremental result processing** instead of collecting all results before returning
- **Cache intermediate results** for expensive algorithms (PageRank, ShortestPath)
- **Parallelize independent operations** with `Task.async_stream/3`
- **Use dirty schedulers** for CPU-bound operations
- **Implement early-stopping** for search algorithms when appropriate

### 5. Subscription System Optimization

Current approach: Direct process messaging for all events

Recommendations:
- **Group subscribers by event types** for more efficient delivery
- **Buffer events** and deliver in batches
- **Use Registry for PubSub** instead of direct process messaging
- **Implement backpressure** for slow subscribers

### 6. Memory Usage Optimization

Recommendations:
- **Use structs with enforced keys** to reduce memory overhead
- **Implement periodic garbage collection** for deleted records
- **Store references instead of duplicating data** between related entities
- **Stream large result sets** rather than loading them all into memory

### 7. Implementation Priorities

Based on benchmarking results, the following implementations should be prioritized:

1. **Immediate Wins (1-2 days)**
   - Add read/write concurrency flags to ETS tables
   - Implement match specifications for queries
   - Fix inefficient pagination in queries

2. **Short-term Improvements (1 week)**
   - Create secondary indices for edge traversal
   - Optimize subscription delivery system
   - Implement batched operations for bulk processing

3. **Longer-term Optimizations (2-4 weeks)**
   - Refactor algorithms to use incremental processing
   - Implement caching for expensive computations
   - Add distributed processing capabilities for large graphs

### 8. Performance Metrics From Testing

Current baseline performance metrics:
- Node creation: ~0.004-0.01ms per node
- PageRank algorithm: ~150-850ms depending on iterations (500 nodes)
- BFS traversal: ~50-460ms depending on depth (500 nodes)
- Connected components: ~2-6ms for finding components (500 nodes)
- Event publishing: ~0.01-0.11ms per subscriber

These metrics should be tracked after implementing each optimization to measure improvement.

## Additional Performance Optimization Opportunities

Based on the performance testing and analysis conducted on March 28, 2025, the following additional optimizations are recommended for the next phase of GraphOS performance enhancements:

### 1. Specialized Edge Type Indexing

Current approach:
```elixir
# Edge indices only by source and target
def get_outgoing_edges(store_name, node_id) do
  source_idx_table = make_table_name(store_name, :edge_source_idx)
  edge_table = make_table_name(store_name, :edge)
  # ...
end
```

Recommendation:
- **Create edge type-specific indices** for frequently queried edge types
- **Implement specialized access functions** for edge type filters
- **Pre-compute aggregations** for common edge type metrics

Example implementation:
```elixir
def get_outgoing_edges_by_type(store_name, node_id, edge_type) do
  # More efficient than filtering after retrieval
end
```

### 2. Advanced Query Optimization

Current approach:
- Match specifications for basic filtering
- In-memory processing for complex queries

Recommendations:
- **Compile common match specifications** at startup
- **Implement a query planner** for multi-stage queries
- **Use continuation tokens** for large result pagination

### 3. Parallel Algorithm Execution

Current approach:
- Sequential processing in algorithms

Recommendations:
- **Parallelize independent algorithm components** using Task
- **Implement work-stealing strategies** for balanced load
- **Add actor model** for concurrent graph operations

Example implementation:
```elixir
defp parallel_bfs(nodes, visited, opts) do
  # Split nodes into chunks
  # Process chunks in parallel with Task.async_stream
  # Combine results efficiently
end
```

### 4. Memory Optimization

Current approach:
- Standard ETS storage without compression

Recommendations:
- **Enable table compression** for large datasets
- **Implement record compaction** for fragmented tables
- **Add tiered storage** for less frequently accessed data

### 5. Distributed Processing

Current approach:
- Single-node processing

Recommendations:
- **Implement graph partitioning** for cross-node distribution
- **Add distributed algorithms** for large-scale graph processing
- **Create federation layer** for multi-node queries

### 6. Graph Materialization Optimizations

Current approach:
- Compute all graph views on demand

Recommendations:
- **Pre-materialize common subgraphs** for faster access
- **Cache frequently accessed aggregate values**
- **Implement incremental view updates** rather than full recalculation

### 7. Extensible Caching Framework

Build upon the successful path caching implementation with:
- **General-purpose query cache** for all types of operations
- **Versioned cache entries** for graph mutations
- **Distributed cache** with cross-node invalidation

### Implementation Priority

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Parallel Algorithm Execution
   - Graph Materialization Optimizations
   - Extensible Caching Framework

3. **Long-term**

## Composite Index for Very Large Graphs

Recent benchmark tests conducted on March 28, 2025 with very large graph datasets (10,000 nodes, 50,000 edges) demonstrate significant performance improvements through composite indexing strategies:

**Current Implementation:**
```elixir
# Create a composite source+type index
source_type_idx_table = make_table_name(store_name, :edge_source_type_idx)
:ets.new(source_type_idx_table, edge_index_opts)

# Store in the composite index when inserting edges
if type = Map.get(edge.data, "type") do
  source_type_idx = {{edge.source, type}, edge.id}
  :ets.insert(source_type_idx_table, source_type_idx)
end

# Use optimized lookup function
def get_outgoing_edges_by_type_optimized(store_name, source_id, edge_type) do
  # Directly lookup edges by source+type composite key
  :ets.lookup(source_type_idx_table, {source_id, edge_type})
  # Process results...
end
```

**Benchmark Results:**
- Standard traversal filtering: 204.20ms

## Parallel Processing for Extreme-Scale Graph Operations

For graphs with extremely large datasets (>100K edges), parallel processing strategies provide significant performance improvements:

**Current Implementation:**
```elixir
def get_outgoing_edges_by_type_parallel(store_name, source_id, edge_type, opts) do
  # Determine optimal concurrency level
  max_concurrency = Keyword.get(opts, :max_concurrency, System.schedulers_online())
  
  # Partition work into balanced chunks
  source_type_entries
  |> Enum.chunk_every(...)
  |> Enum.map(fn batch ->
    Task.async(fn -> process_batch(batch) end)
  end)
  |> Enum.flat_map(&Task.await/1)
end
```

**Benchmark Results:**
